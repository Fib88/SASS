# SASS

In this project I'm learning about understanding SASS.
While I understand the theory, I'm having trouble implementing nesting.

update: 
Found out how to use nesting and gained understanding of implementing variables/classes from sass into the html files.

Starting to understand the usage off SASS I'm having most trouble with the syntax and the implementation.
